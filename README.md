# LLL-algorithm
The LLL algorithm is used for lattice basis reduction and has many practical applications in integer programming, cryptography, and other areas.

The algorithm is implemented in the lattice header file. The purpose of the program and scripts is to observe the impact that different alpha values make on different lattices of higher dimension.
